1
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,056
Are you paying attention?

2
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,561
Good.

3
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,524
If you're not listening
carefully you will miss things.

4
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,444
Important things.

5
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,780
I will not pause,
I will not repeat myself

6
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,575
and you will not interrupt me.

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,788
If you think that
because you're sitting where you are

8
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,290
and I am sitting where I am

9
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:08,544
that you are in control
of what is about to happen,

10
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,297
you're mistaken.

11
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,591
I am in control,

12
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,677
because I know things
that you do not know.

13
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,975
Manchester Police Department.
Please hold.

14
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,560
Looks like a break-in.

15
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,812
Residence of Turing, Alan.

16
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,939
Window's broken. Home's been ransacked.

17
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,067
Send a detective down, will you?

18
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,944
What I will need from you now

19
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,030
is a commitment.

20
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:40,868
You will listen closely and you will not
judge me until I am finished.

21
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,830
If you cannot commit to this,
then please leave the room.

22
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,083
Come in.

23
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,211
But if you choose to stay,
remember, you chose to be here.

24
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,340
What happens from this moment
forward is not my responsibility.

25
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,342
It's yours.

26
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,722
Pay attention.

27
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,153
What's all this, then?

28
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,948
Turing, Alan.
Professor at King's.

29
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,660
- Seems to have been a burglary.
- Oh? What of?

30
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,620
Well, that's just it.
Nothing missing, really.

31
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,832
What's he doing in Manchester?

32
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,960
Something with machines.

33
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,511
The project at the NPL.

34
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,180
I checked
but he won't say what it's on.

35
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,559
Professor Turing?

36
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,061
Detective Nock, Manchester Police.

37
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,152
Sergeant Staehl here tells me
you had a burglary last night.

38
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,529
Professor Turing?

39
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,533
Take a step back
and don't breathe heavily.

40
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,202
- Breathe?
- Undiluted cyanide.

41
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,664
It wouldn't take more
than a thimbleful to kill you.

42
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,750
Ah.

43
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,712
- Disappointing.
- Pardon?

44
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,840
I had hoped for a bit more.

45
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,801
Sergeant Staehl, is it just me or do you
get the sense that we're being insulted?

46
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,596
Last night you had a break-in.

47
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,182
Your neighbour Mr Springborn
called to report the noise.

48
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,892
He said there was quite a ruckus.

49
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,561
Only you say nothing was taken.
It's odd.

50
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,314
So how about you tell us what happened
and we'll find the chap who did this.

51
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,524
Gentlemen,

52
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,569
I don't believe that you could find
the chap that did this

53
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,572
if he walked up to you
and spat in your face.

54
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,993
What I could use right now is not
a bobby but a really good cleaning lady.

55
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,746
So unless one of you has an apron
in your car,

56
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,041
I suggest you file your reports
and leave me alone.

57
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,961
As you say, Professor Turing.

58
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,468
Best of luck with your cyanide.

59
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,971
I'll give you a quid if you
can name me a more insufferable sod.

60
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,932
Seemed a bit forced, though, didn't it?

61
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,558
Don't know what you mean.

62
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,101
Well, if you didn't
want a pair of bobbies

63
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,520
digging around in your personal affairs,

64
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,439
that'd have been a stellar way
to make sure they don't.

65
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,275
Tell me you don't think
this is suspicious.

66
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,401
I don't think this is suspicious.

67
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,612
A mysterious professor who won't admit

68
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,489
he's had something stolen
from his house?

69
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,118
I think Alan Turing's hiding something.

70
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,715
War declared!
800,000 children evacuated!

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,676
German bombs on their way!

72
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,927
Get your papers here.

73
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,095
Fresh off the press.

74
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,429
War declared!

75
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,807
800,000 children evacuated!

76
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,475
German bombs expected soon!

77
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,185
Get your papers here.

78
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,353
Fresh off the press.

79
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,547
This morning,
the British Ambassador in Berlin

80
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,384
handed the German government
a final note,

81
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,304
stating that unless we heard from them

82
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,097
by 11 o'clock,

83
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,267
a state of war would exist between us.

84
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,395
I have to tell you now

85
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,730
that no such undertaking

86
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,148
has been received.

87
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,817
And that consequently,

88
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,321
this country is at war with Germany.

89
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,891
For the second time

90
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,976
in the lives of most of us,

91
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,563
we are at war.

92
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,067
We have tried to find

93
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,861
a peaceful way out...

94
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,199
Papers, please.

95
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,823
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, the lady told me to wait.

96
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,449
In my office?

97
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,744
Did she tell you to help yourself to tea
while you were here?

98
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,247
Uh... No, she didn't.

99
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,750
She obviously didn't tell you
what a joke was then, either, I gather?

100
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,585
Was she supposed to?

101
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,965
- Who are you?
- Alan Turing.

102
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,512
- Ah, Turing. The mathematician.
- Correct.

103
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,264
However could I have guessed?

104
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,307
You didn't.
You just read it on that piece of paper.

105
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,020
King's College, Cambridge.

106
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,314
Now it says here you were a bit
of a prodigy in the Maths Department.

107
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,317
I'm not sure I can evaluate that, Mr...

108
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,570
- How old are you, Mr Turing?
- Uh, 27.

109
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,947
And how old were you when you
became a fellow at Cambridge?

110
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,198
Twenty-four.

111
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,325
And how old were you
when you published this paper

112
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,202
that has a title
that I can barely understand?

113
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,163
Uh, 23.

114
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,124
And you don't think that qualifies you
as a certified prodigy?

115
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,419
Well, Newton discovered Binomial Theorem
aged 22.

116
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,173
Einstein wrote four papers that changed
the world by the age of 26.

117
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,634
As far as I can tell, I've...
I've barely made par.

118
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,929
- My God, you're serious.
- Would you prefer I made a joke?

119
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,307
Oh, I don't think you know
what those are.

120
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,933
Hardly seems fair
that that's a requirement

121
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,477
for employment here, Mr...

122
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,312
Commander Denniston, Royal Navy.

123
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,938
All right, Mr Turing, I'll bite.

124
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,316
Why do you wish to work
for His Majesty's Government?

125
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,193
Oh, I don't, really.

126
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,196
Are you a bleeding pacifist?

127
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,365
I'm agnostic about violence.

128
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,202
But you do realise that 600 miles
away from London

129
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,329
there's this nasty little chap
called Hitler

130
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,372
who wants to engulf Europe in tyranny?

131
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,042
Politics isn't really my area
of expertise.

132
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,543
Really?

133
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,504
Well, I believe
you've just set the record

134
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,215
for the shortest job interview
in British military history.

135
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,841
Oh, uh...

136
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,510
Mother says I can be
off-putting sometimes

137
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,678
on account of being one of the best
mathematicians in the world.

138
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,515
- In the world?
- Oh, yes.

139
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,685
Do you know how many people
I've rejected for this programme?

140
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,020
- No.
- That's right.

141
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,814
Because we're a top secret programme.

142
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,024
But I'll tell you,
just because we're friends,

143
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:13,570
that only last week I rejected
one of our great nation's top linguists.

144
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,989
Knows German better than Bertolt Brecht.

145
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,908
- I don't speak German.
- What?

146
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,037
I don't speak German.

147
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,040
Well, how the hell are you supposed
to decrypt German communications

148
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,626
if you don't...
I don't know, speak German?

149
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,711
Well, I'm really quite excellent
at crossword puzzles.

150
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,755
Margaret!

151
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,509
German codes are a puzzle.
A game just like any other game.

152
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,094
- Margaret, where are you?
- I'm really very good at games,

153
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,220
uh, puzzles.

154
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,806
And this is the most difficult puzzle
in the world.

155
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,391
Margaret!

156
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,892
For the love of God.

157
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,561
This is a joke, obviously.

158
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,232
I'm afraid I don't know what those are,
Commander Denniston.

159
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,901
Have a pleasant trip back
to Cambridge, Professor.

160
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:53,986
Enigma.

161
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,654
You called for me?

162
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:08,542
That's what you're doing here.
The top secret programme at Bletchley.

163
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,795
You're trying to break
the German Enigma machine.

164
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,256
What makes you think that?

165
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,092
It's the greatest encryption device
in history

166
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,429
and the Germans use it
for all major communications.

167
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,640
If the Allies broke Enigma, well,

168
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,312
this would turn into
a very short war indeed.

169
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,190
Of course that's what you're working on.

170
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,649
You also haven't got anywhere with it.

171
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,611
If you had, you wouldn't be hiring
cryptographers out of university.

172
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,155
You need me a lot more than I need you.

173
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,366
I... I like solving problems, Commander.

174
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,121
And Enigma is the most difficult
problem in the world.

175
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,624
Oh, Enigma isn't difficult.
It's impossible.

176
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,126
The Americans,
the Russians, the French,

177
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,504
the Germans.
Everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable.

178
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,800
Good. Let me try,
then we'll know for sure, won't we?

179
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,138
Welcome to Enigma.

180
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:11,146
The details of every surprise attack,
every secret convoy,

181
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,484
and every U-boat in the bloody Atlantic
go into that thing

182
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,820
and out comes gibberish.

183
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,865
It's beautiful.

184
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,160
It's the crooked hand of death itself.

185
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,665
Our Wrens intercept thousands
of radio messages a day.

186
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,293
And to the lovely young ladies
of the Women's Royal Navy,

187
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,670
they're nonsense.

188
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,507
It's only when you feed them back
into Enigma that they make any sense.

189
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,259
But we have an Enigma machine.

190
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,011
Yes, Polish Intelligence
smuggled it out of Berlin.

191
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,137
So what's the problem?

192
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,556
Just put the intercepted messages
back into the Enigma and...

193
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,685
Look, it's not that simple. Is it?

194
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,689
Just having an Enigma machine
doesn't help you to decode the messages.

195
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,358
Very good, Mr Turing.

196
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,861
To decode a message, you need
to know the machine's settings.

197
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,658
Now, the Germans switch settings
every day, promptly at midnight.

198
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,203
We usually intercept our first message
around 6:00am.

199
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:13,625
Which gives you exactly
18 hours every day to crack the code

200
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,044
before it changes and you start again.

201
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,715
Five rotors. 10 plugboard cables.

202
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,134
- That's one million...
- 1,000 million.

203
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,844
- No, it's... I've got it.
- It's a million million.

204
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,387
Well, it's in the millions,
obviously.

205
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,473
There's over 150 million million million
possible settings.

206
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,225
Very good.

207
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,895
One hundred and fifty-nine,
if you want to be exact about it,

208
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,232
1-5-9 with 18 zeros behind it.

209
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,900
Possibilities.

210
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,902
Every single day.

211
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,447
Gentlemen,
meet Hugh Alexander.

212
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,783
I personally selected him
to run this unit.

213
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,951
Didn't you...

214
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,078
Mr Alexander won Britain's
national chess championship.

215
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,956
- Twice.
- You're not the only one

216
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,751
who's good at games round here, Turing.

217
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,296
Are we to work together, then?
I prefer to have my own office.

218
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,922
You're a team and you will work as one.

219
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,176
I don't have time to explain myself
as I go along

220
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,762
and I'm afraid these men
would only slow me down.

221
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,014
If you can't play together,

222
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,224
then I'm afraid
we can't let you play at all.

223
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,226
This is Stewart Menzies. MI6.

224
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,896
There are only five divisions
of Military Intelligence.

225
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,690
- There is no MI6.
- Exactly.

226
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,275
That's the spirit.

227
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,279
Mr Turing, do you know
how many British servicemen have died

228
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,614
because of Enigma?

229
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,033
- Uh, no, I don't.
- Three.

230
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,286
While we've been having
this conversation.

231
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,040
Oh, look, there's another.

232
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,001
I rather hope he didn't have a family.

233
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,380
This war Commander Denniston's
been going on about,

234
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,507
we're not winning it.

235
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,468
Break the code,
at least we have a chance.

236
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,641
Shall we leave the children alone
with their new toy?

237
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,481
All right, gentlemen...

238
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,403
let's play.

239
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,158
The game was quite a simple one.

240
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,913
Every single German message,

241
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,833
every surprise attack,
every bombing run,

242
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,959
every, uh...

243
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,336
...imminent U-boat assault.

244
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,552
They were all floating
through the air.

245
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,896
Radio signals that,

246
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,943
well, any schoolboy
with an AM kit could intercept.

247
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,615
The trick was that they were encrypted.

248
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,879
One hundred and fifty-nine
million million million

249
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,839
possible Enigma settings.

250
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,509
All we had to do was try each one.

251
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,432
But if we had 10 men
checking one setting a minute

252
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,895
for 24 hours every day
and seven days every week,

253
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:26,401
how many days do you think it would take
to check each of the settings?

254
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,907
It's not days, it's years.

255
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,745
It's 20 million years.

256
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,623
To stop a coming attack,

257
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:44,085
we would have to check
20 million years' worth of settings

258
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,588
in 20 minutes.

259
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,034
I'm famished. Lunch?

260
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,288
Good Lord, what is it about women
with little hats?

261
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,507
The boys...
We're going to get some lunch.

262
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,263
Alan?

263
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,890
- Yes?
- I said we're going to get some lunch.

264
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,354
- Alan?
- Yes?

265
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,856
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

266
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,317
I said we're off to get some...

267
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,486
This is starting to get
a little bit repetitive.

268
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,654
What is?

269
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,531
I had asked if you wanted
to come to lunch with us.

270
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,199
Er, no, you didn't.

271
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,410
You said you were going
to get some lunch.

272
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,537
Have I offended you in some way?

273
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,038
Why would you think that?

274
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,374
Would you like to come
to lunch with us?

275
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,542
What time's lunchtime?

276
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,503
- Christ, Alan, it's a bleeding sandwich.
- What is?

277
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,631
- Lunch.
- I don't like sandwiches.

278
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,174
Never mind.

279
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,804
You know, to pull off
this irascible genius routine,

280
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,764
one actually has to be a genius, Alan.

281
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,267
And yet we're the ones
making progress here, aren't we?

282
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,768
You are?

283
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,353
Yes, we are.

284
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,316
We have decrypted a number
of German messages

285
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,901
by analysing the frequency
of letter distribution.

286
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,030
Oh, even a broken clock is right
twice a day.

287
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,365
That's not progress.
That's just blind luck.

288
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,369
I'm designing a machine that will
allow us to break every message,

289
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,247
every day, instantly.

290
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,876
Who's hungry?

291
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,046
- Let's go.
- I'm hungry.

292
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,092
- What?
- Peter asked who was hungry.

293
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,594
Can I have some soup, please?

294
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,016
What do you mean, classified?

295
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,603
No, I am aware of the literal meaning
of the word "classified",

296
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,313
what I'm asking is
why would a maths professor

297
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,482
have his military records classified?

298
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,528
Yeah, well, I will come down.

299
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,801
Pardon me, I'd like to see
some documents, if I may.

300
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,305
Service records of a Mr... Turing, Alan.

301
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,224
Foreign Office sent me.

302
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,191
This is unacceptable.

303
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,818
If you wish to discuss a complaint,

304
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,320
I suggest you make a proper appointment.

305
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,030
Alexander... Complaint?

306
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:27,076
No. No, Hugh Alexander has denied
my requisition for parts and equipment

307
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,620
that I need to build the machine
I have designed.

308
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,080
Your fellow code-breakers
are refusing to work with you

309
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,832
and they've filed a formal complaint.

310
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,584
It is inspired
by an old Polish code machine,

311
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,337
only this one is
infinitely more advanced.

312
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,880
If you don't respond to the complaint,

313
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,757
I shall have to take it up
with the Home Office.

314
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,300
Put those files by my desk.

315
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,843
Fine. My response is they're all idiots,

316
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,970
fire them and use the savings
to fund my machine.

317
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,431
I only need about £100,000.

318
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,226
£100,000?

319
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,604
Why are you building a machine?

320
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,941
It's highly technical,
you wouldn't understand.

321
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,276
I suggest you make the effort to try.

322
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,949
Enigma is an extremely
well-designed machine.

323
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,118
Our problem is that
we're only using men to try to beat it.

324
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:12,747
What if only a machine
can defeat another machine?

325
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,999
Well, that's not very technical.

326
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,544
Hugh Alexander
is in charge of your unit.

327
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,087
He said no and that is that.

328
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,964
I simply don't have time for this.

329
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,675
Have you ever won a war, Turing?

330
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,095
I have. Do you know how it's done?

331
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,181
Order. Discipline. Chain of command.

332
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,475
You're not at university any longer.

333
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,728
You are a very small cog
in a very large system

334
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,982
and you will do
as your commanding officer instructs.

335
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,280
Who... Who is your commanding officer?

336
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:50,493
Winston Churchill,
Number 10 Downing Street, London SW1.

337
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,163
You have a problem with my decision,
you can take it up with him.

338
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,298
Mr Menzies. Mr Menzies!

339
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,678
Are you going to London?

340
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,641
- Possibly.
- Would you deliver a letter for me?

341
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,483
Look, I'm sorry, but are you joking?

342
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,986
Churchill's put Alan in charge?

343
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,447
- This is a terrible idea.
- No, no, no...

344
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,866
So I can give these men orders now?

345
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,951
I hate to say it but yes.

346
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,995
Excellent. Keith and Charles,
you're both fired.

347
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,706
- Excuse me?
- What?

348
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,500
You're mediocre linguists
and positively poor code-breakers.

349
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,003
Alan, you can't just fire
Keith and Charles.

350
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,463
Well, he just said I could.

351
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,006
No, I did no such thing.

352
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,591
But Churchill did.

353
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,353
Go to hell.

354
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,027
Well, this is inhuman.

355
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,446
Even for you.

356
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,203
Popular at school, were you?

357
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,627
The problem began, of course,

358
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,212
with the carrots.

359
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,547
The carrots are orange.

360
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:31,094
The peas are green. They mustn't touch.

361
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,287
Do you know why people like violence?

362
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,500
It is because it feels good.

363
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,254
Humans find violence deeply satisfying.

364
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,426
But remove the satisfaction

365
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,680
and the act becomes hollow.

366
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,688
Turing?

367
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,107
Come on.

368
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,817
Don't be such a kike about it.

369
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,863
Leave him to bloody rot.

370
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,663
I didn't learn this on my own,
of course.

371
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,165
I had help.

372
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,460
Christopher helped.

373
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,464
Alan, are you all right?

374
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,140
It's not my fault.
The carrots got in with the peas and...

375
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,477
I'm sorry, I won't let them do it again.

376
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,978
They're getting worse.

377
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,148
They only beat me up
because I'm smarter than they are.

378
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,150
No, they beat you up
because you're different.

379
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,695
- Mother says I'm just an odd duck.
- And she's right.

380
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,448
But you know, Alan,

381
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,576
sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

382
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,871
who do the things no one can imagine.

383
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,837
So what do we do now?

384
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:35,093
- We're short on staff.
- Well, we, uh, we get more staff, then.

385
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,429
And how do you propose to do that?

386
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,872
Erm, Alan Turing
to see Stewart Menzies.

387
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,499
Very good, sir.

388
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,334
So who are they?

389
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,879
Oh, all sorts, really.
A teacher. An engineer.

390
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,506
A handful of students.

391
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,341
And you think
they're qualified for Bletchley

392
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,717
'cause they're good
at crossword puzzles?

393
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,887
Well, they say they're good
and now we shall find out, won't we?

394
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,890
In order to aid your efforts,

395
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,601
there is, to the right of you,
a green scratch card book.

396
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,145
You are to make notes in that.
Gentlemen, you have six minutes

397
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,065
in which to complete the puzzle,
at which point I will...

398
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,278
Pardon me, ma'am,
this room's restricted.

399
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,030
Oh, apologies for my tardiness.
The bus caught a flat tyre.

400
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,700
May I continue, please? Thank you.

401
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,453
- You're not allowed in here, ma'am.
- Oh, but I'm only a few minutes late...

402
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,873
The secretaries are to head upstairs.
This room's for the candidates.

403
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,042
May I get on with this now, please?

404
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,379
- Uh, I am a candidate.
- For what position?

405
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,880
The letter didn't say, precisely.

406
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,424
Yes, the secretaries
are to head upstairs.

407
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,259
It did say that it was top secret.

408
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,428
What is going on?

409
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,180
I... I solved a crossword puzzle
in the newspaper

410
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,682
and I got this letter saying

411
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,934
that I was a candidate
for some sort of mysterious job.

412
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,728
My name's Joan Clarke.

413
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,731
Miss, did you really solve
this puzzle yourself?

414
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,402
What makes you think
I couldn't solve the puzzle myself?

415
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,820
I'm really very good at...

416
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,196
Ma'am, I'll have to ask you to...

417
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:29,243
Miss Clarke, I find tardiness
under any circumstance unacceptable.

418
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,958
Take a seat so that we may continue.

419
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,588
Thank you.

420
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,382
Now, as I was saying,

421
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:47,762
you have six minutes
to complete the task in front of you.

422
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,431
Erm, gentlemen, and lady...

423
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,308
begin.

424
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,171
Six minutes.

425
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,342
- Is that even possible?
- No, no. Takes me eight.

426
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,761
This isn't about crossword puzzles.

427
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,847
It's about how one approaches
solving an impossible problem.

428
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,726
Do you tackle the whole thing
at once or divide it into small...

429
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,146
You've finished?

430
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,689
Yes.

431
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,872
Five minutes and 34 seconds.

432
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,583
You said to do it in under six.

433
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,336
Congratulations.

434
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,089
My warmest welcome
to His Majesty's Service.

435
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,842
If you speak a word
of what I'm about to show you,

436
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,677
you will be executed for high treason.

437
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,431
You will lie to your friends,
your family

438
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:16,517
and everyone you meet
about what it is you really do.

439
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,688
And what is it that we're really doing?

440
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,191
We're going to break an unbreakable
Nazi code and win the war.

441
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,194
Oh.

442
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,747
What's that you're reading?

443
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,751
- It's about cryptography.
- Like secret messages?

444
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,214
Not secret. That's the brilliant part.

445
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,551
Messages that anyone can see
but no one knows what they mean

446
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,553
unless you have the key.

447
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,561
How's that different from talking?

448
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,230
- Talking?
- When people talk to each other,

449
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,192
they never say what they mean,
they say something else.

450
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,195
And you're expected
to just know what they mean.

451
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,821
Only I never do.

452
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,781
So...

453
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,825
how's that different?

454
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,288
Alan, I have a funny feeling
you're going to be very good at this.

455
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,857
Goodnight, Alan.

456
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,364
Goodnight.

457
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,386
Careful, will you? It's not a toy.

458
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,805
Funny. Looks like a toy.

459
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:22,142
Bloody great £100,000 one.
Your new minion's arrived.

460
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,312
- Jack Good. We met...
- Well, where's Miss Clarke?

461
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,651
Lovely, isn't he?

462
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:35,406
It's not just a usual
humdrum production mill factory.

463
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:40,369
I mean, well, as I was saying,
it's a very important radio factory.

464
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,288
It's not, actually.

465
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:47,710
On the spectrum of radio
factories, this one is particularly...

466
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,140
Why are you not at Bletchley?

467
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,809
Thank you so much for your visit,
Mr Turing.

468
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,270
- Was your trip pleasant?
- Gather your things and let's go.

469
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,273
I'm sorry but I'm unable
to accept your offer.

470
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,943
We feel that such a position
would hardly be appropriate.

471
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,613
You earned a double first
in mathematics.

472
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,574
But sadly, wasn't granted
the opportunity to become a fellow.

473
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,659
You belong at Bletchley.

474
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,830
I'm sorry, but for someone
in my position to live, to...

475
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,709
to work in a radio factory
so far from home,

476
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,129
with all your men, erm, it would be...

477
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,132
indecorous.

478
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,803
What in the world does that even mean?

479
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:48,937
We have a group of young ladies
who tend to all of our clerical tasks.

480
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,856
Assistants, translators.

481
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,567
They live, erm, together in town.

482
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:57,029
Would that be
a more suitable environment?

483
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,492
Hmm. So... So I would be working
amongst these women?

484
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,160
Yes.

485
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,665
Wonderful ladies.

486
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:11,168
They even organise social events
at St Martin's church down the road.

487
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,796
Really, the whole thing is quite, er,

488
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,131
um, decorous.

489
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,806
Now, you won't have
proper security clearance, of course,

490
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,475
so we'll have to improvise things a bit.

491
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,018
Why are you helping me?

492
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,480
Because there is only one thing that
matters in this entire world right now,

493
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,482
do you understand?
And that is breaking Enigma.

494
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,275
But... But Mr Turing...

495
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,904
Why are you helping me?

496
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,407
Oh, um...

497
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,994
Sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

498
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,164
who do the things
that no one can imagine.

499
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,435
Sir.

500
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:13,814
- What this?
- Alan Turing's classified military file.

501
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,734
- Bloody empty.
- Exactly.

502
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,653
- It's an empty Manila envelope.
- Yeah.

503
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,282
You've cracked the case wide open, then,
haven't you?

504
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,743
Alan Turing's war records
aren't just classified,

505
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,286
they're non-existent.

506
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,832
That means someone's got rid of them,
erased them, burnt them.

507
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,043
And that same person broke
into his house and stole nothing?

508
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,338
Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.

509
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,884
- What, the spies from the papers?
- Soviet spies.

510
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,845
But first they were professors,
weren't they?

511
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,390
Radicalised at Cambridge,
then they joined the Communist Party,

512
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:49,641
then the Foreign Office,

513
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,935
then leaked information to Stalin
during the war.

514
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,521
Now, can you think of anyone else
we know who was at Cambridge,

515
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,858
then took up something murky
and top secret when the war broke out?

516
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,361
You think this Alan Turing
might be a Soviet agent?

517
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:06,283
I think something very serious
is happening right here under our noses.

518
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,912
Wouldn't you like
to find out what it is?

519
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,947
Welcome, ladies.
If you'd like to follow me.

520
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,035
Some people thought
we were at war with the Germans.

521
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,161
Incorrect.

522
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,330
We were at war with the clock.

523
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,874
Britain was literally starving to death.

524
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:01,088
The Americans sent over 100,000 tonnes
of food every week

525
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,758
and every week the Germans would
send our desperately needed bread

526
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,468
to the bottom of the ocean.

527
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:10,055
Our daily failure was announced
at the chimes of midnight.

528
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,809
And the sound would haunt
our unwelcome dreams.

529
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,311
Tick, tock.

530
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,063
Tick.

531
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,029
Damn it!

532
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,534
- What just happened?
- Midnight.

533
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,662
All the work we've done today
is useless.

534
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,330
Oh, but don't worry, we've a few hours

535
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,791
before tomorrow's messages
start flooding in,

536
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,294
then we start all over again.

537
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,715
- From scratch.
- I'm so sick of this.

538
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,718
Four hours rewiring
his plugboard matrix.

539
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,304
Three hours yesterday
on his rotor positions.

540
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,307
- Don't go over there.
- Look, John, no.

541
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,476
If this job wasn't already impossible
before, it bloody well is now.

542
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,978
Hugh, don't.

543
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,864
Damn you and your useless machine.

544
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,035
My machine is how we are going to win.

545
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,661
Really?

546
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,663
This machine?

547
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,167
Are you talking about
this bloody machine?

548
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,877
- Hugh!
- Hugh, don't! Don't!

549
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,296
- Stop!
- You arrogant bastard.

550
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,923
You could help us.

551
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,258
You could make this go faster
but you won't.

552
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,887
Get off.

553
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,977
He's right, Alan.

554
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,942
There are actual soldiers out there
trying to win an actual war.

555
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,654
My brother protects
food convoys in the Navy.

556
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,406
My cousins fly RAF patrols.

557
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:56,036
All my friends, they're all making
a difference while we just

558
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,831
while away our days producing nothing.

559
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,876
Because of you.

560
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,881
My machine will work.

561
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,385
Come on, Peter.

562
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,926
Okay.

563
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,666
Joan!

564
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,653
Could you have made a bit more noise?
I'm not quite sure my landlady woke up.

565
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,906
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, uh, look.

566
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,493
I think that's the best I can do.
No male visitors after dark.

567
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,122
- So, what did you bring me?
- Erm...

568
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,500
- There you go.
- Here.

569
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,586
Some men try flowers, you know.

570
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:14,007
These are actual decrypted Enigma
messages direct from Nazi High Command.

571
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,346
"0600 hours, weather today is clear.

572
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,681
"Rain in the evening. Heil Hitler."

573
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,727
Well, clearly that vital piece of
information is going to win us the war.

574
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,896
It's the relationship
between the encrypted

575
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,690
and decrypted messages
that interests me.

576
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:34,653
Can we find a clue here
that we can build into Christopher?

577
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,280
- Who's Christopher?
- Oh, he's my machine.

578
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,658
You named him?

579
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,827
Is that a bad name?

580
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,621
No.

581
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,040
No, never mind.

582
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,674
Are you trying to build
your universal machine?

583
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,803
I read your paper at university.

584
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,055
- Is it already being taught?
- No.

585
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,683
No. No, I was precocious.

586
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:08,687
So, you theorised a machine
that could solve any problem?

587
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,939
It didn't just do one thing,
it did everything?

588
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,150
It wasn't just programmable,
it was re-programmable?

589
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,317
Mmm.

590
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:16,695
Is that your idea behind Christopher?

591
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,200
Human brains can compute large sums
very quickly, even Hugh can do that,

592
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,202
but I want Christopher to be smarter.

593
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,999
To make a calculation
and then to determine what to do next.

594
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,501
Like a person does.

595
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,920
Think of it.

596
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,755
An electrical brain.

597
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,799
A digital computer.

598
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,468
Digital computer?

599
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,722
Hmm.

600
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,862
What's going on?

601
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,822
What's happening?

602
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,700
- No, no, no. Don't touch that.
- Stay back.

603
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:04,910
That's my desk.

604
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,164
Thank goodness. I'd hate to think
we were searching the wrong one.

605
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,790
What are you doing? What's going on?

606
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,169
There is a spy in Bletchley Park.

607
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,838
The Navy thinks that one of us
is a Soviet double agent, Alan.

608
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,840
Why?

609
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,552
Our boys intercepted this
on its way to Moscow.

610
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,221
Look familiar?

611
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,643
It's a Beale cipher.

612
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,854
Encrypted with a phrase from a book
or a poem or...

613
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,986
You...

614
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,365
You don't seriously think I did this,
do you?

615
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,159
Double agents are such bastards.

616
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:51,039
Isolated loners.
No attachments to friends or family.

617
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,749
Arrogant.

618
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,834
Know anybody like that?

619
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,756
I...

620
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,425
Hmm. I know you don't like me

621
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,637
but that does not make me a Soviet spy.

622
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,056
Nothing out of the ordinary, sir.

623
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,394
Really? Hmm, all right.

624
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,607
The Home Office
may be protecting you now

625
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,818
but sooner or later,
you will make a mistake.

626
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,071
And I needn't bother firing you.

627
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,448
They will hang you for treason.

628
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,680
Hello.

629
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,975
I heard about what happened.

630
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,311
It's all the girls in Hut 3
can talk about.

631
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,940
I have an idea of what
might cheer you up.

632
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,613
So, because no letter can be
encoded as itself,

633
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:08,241
there's already a handful of settings
that can be rejected at the outset.

634
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,790
- Is that your team?
- Uh, yes.

635
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,334
- Shall we say hello?
- No.

636
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:18,835
Hello.

637
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,962
I told you not to do that.

638
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,049
Alan.

639
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,593
- Uh, Hugh, hello.
- Didn't know you drank.

640
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,845
He doesn't, really.
He just sort of sips at the foam.

641
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,388
I'll let you
into a little secret, Miss...

642
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,349
- Clarke.
- Miss Clarke.

643
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,851
- Please.
- Foam's my favourite part, too.

644
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,562
- Is it really?
- Come and join us for a drink.

645
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,273
- We'll be there in a moment.
- Miss Clarke.

646
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,365
Well, he likes you.

647
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,949
- Yes.
- You, uh...

648
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,745
You got him to like you.

649
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,706
- Yes.
- Why?

650
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,167
Because I'm a woman in a man's job

651
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,461
and I don't have the luxury
of being an arse.

652
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,840
Alan, it doesn't matter
how smart you are,

653
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,009
Enigma is always smarter.

654
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,930
If you really want to solve your puzzle,

655
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,140
then you're going to need
all the help you can get

656
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:18,186
and they are not going to help you
if they do not like you.

657
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,195
What are those?

658
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,781
- Apples.
- No.

659
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,325
Oh, they really are. Um, I've...

660
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,953
Well, Miss Clarke...
Joan, actually, um,

661
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,997
said that it would be nice

662
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,291
if I was to bring you all something.

663
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,210
So here we are.

664
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,087
- Thank you.
- I like apples.

665
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:46,840
My best to Miss Clarke.

666
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:51,219
Uh, there are two people in a wood
and, um, they run into a bear.

667
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,930
The first person gets down
on his knees to pray.

668
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,890
The second person
starts lacing up his boots.

669
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,809
The first person asks the second person,

670
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:01,062
"My dear friend, what are you doing?
You can't outrun a bear."

671
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:02,814
To which the second person responds,

672
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:06,484
"I don't have to,
I only have to outrun you."

673
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:20,248
I'll be with Christopher
if anyone needs me.

674
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:24,752
If we assume that the
square root of two is a rational number,

675
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:30,550
then we can say that
the square root of two is A over B,

676
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,220
where A and B are whole numbers

677
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:37,182
and B is not zero.

678
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:40,643
- Mr Turing, passing notes, are we?
- No, sir.

679
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:50,487
Only Turing would pass notes
written in gibberish.

680
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,202
All right, gentlemen.

681
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,913
Do not forget your algebra
over the break.

682
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,999
Have a pleasant holiday.

683
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,419
And we'll resume your irrationals
when you return.

684
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:39,577
Mmm.

685
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,582
But Euler's Theorem
gives you that immediately.

686
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,334
Erm...

687
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,554
Here, look at this.

688
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:02,475
If you run the wires across
the plugboard matrix diagonally,

689
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,270
it will eliminate rotor positions
500 times faster.

690
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:10,608
That's, uh,
actually not an entirely terrible idea.

691
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,904
I think that was Alan for "thank you".

692
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,953
- That's my sandwich.
- You don't like sandwiches.

693
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,052
Are you nervous?

694
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,577
What happens now?

695
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,457
Well, it should work out
the day's Enigma settings.

696
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,848
How long?

697
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,786
The German Army
has fanned out across Europe,

698
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,831
from Poland to Serbia,
Lithuania to Denmark, Norway to France.

699
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:52,960
The Nazi flag now flies from more
than two dozen national capitals.

700
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:56,964
Their campaign mounts in fury
as a free Europe crumbles.

701
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,882
Oh, it's still going.

702
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,926
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Margaret.

703
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,346
Gears keep spinning on and on.
Rotors on and on.

704
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,473
It's endless.

705
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:51,853
- With no result in sight?
- No.

706
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,701
Turing.

707
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,673
Turing, open the bloody door.

708
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,508
No. No.

709
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:26,471
Open the door or we'll break it down.

710
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:28,347
I can't let you in.

711
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,016
I cannot let you interfere.

712
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,934
Go on, then.

713
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,860
Turn that thing off!

714
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,196
No. Don't, please.

715
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,364
Please, please, please!

716
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,201
No. No, don't! No, no!

717
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:56,709
Well, then, it seems that your great
big expensive machine doesn't work.

718
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,545
It does.

719
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:03,216
Wonderful.
So you've broken Enigma, then?

720
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,384
It was just...

721
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,221
Still working.

722
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,390
This is my associate
from the Home Office.

723
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,394
You see,
£100,000 is rather a lot of money

724
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,897
and he's here to see
what you have to show for it.

725
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,359
You will never understand

726
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,946
the importance of what
I am creating here!

727
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,242
Have you decrypted any German messages?

728
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,619
A single one?

729
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,623
Can you point to anything at all
that you've achieved?

730
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,917
Hmm.

731
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,796
Your funding is up
and our patience has expired.

732
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:46,509
It's with such great pleasure
that I am finally able to say this.

733
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,803
Alan Turing, you're fired.

734
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,598
Please escort Mr Turing
from the premises.

735
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:55,476
No.

736
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,813
I beg your pardon?

737
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,112
If you fire Alan,

738
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,448
well, then, you'll have to fire me, too.

739
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,367
What on earth are you saying?

740
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,953
Trust me when I tell you there is no one

741
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,372
who would rather say this
less than I do but...

742
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,294
he's right. Alan is right.

743
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:25,548
His machine can work and it's probably
the best chance that we've got.

744
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,134
God, it's beyond belief.

745
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:32,138
If you fire them,
you'll have to fire me, too.

746
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,348
And me.

747
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,226
We're the best
cryptographic minds in Britain.

748
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,395
Are you going to fire us all?

749
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,815
Commander, at least
give us some more time.

750
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,652
Six months. And if the machine doesn't
produce any results that we need,

751
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,488
then we'll go back to doing things
the old way. How about that?

752
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,997
One month.

753
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:01,208
And then so help me God,
you're all gone.

754
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,878
Oh, leave him.

755
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,097
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

756
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,935
Oh, and, Alan, your machine,

757
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,606
it had better bloody work.

758
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:33,115
Hugh...

759
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,534
I swear,

760
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,204
I'm not a spy.

761
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,916
Oh, for God's sake,
of course you're not a bloody spy.

762
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,544
- What?
- Denniston gave me the Beale cipher

763
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,047
and guess what? I cracked it.

764
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,051
"Ask, and it shall be given to you;
seek and ye shall find."

765
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,053
Matthew 7:7. That was the key.

766
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,057
Far too simple for the likes of you.

767
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:01,811
Pity Denniston disagrees.

768
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,906
Come in.

769
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,744
Sir, I think I've got Turing.

770
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:23,624
I tailed him to a pub last night where
he met a bloke. Exchanged an envelope.

771
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:27,753
So I follow this other fella,
pick him up, gave him a good shake.

772
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,758
- He's a poofter. He confessed.
- What?

773
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,970
The man admitted it. Arnold Murray.

774
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,431
Hangs around that pub,
men pay him for a go.

775
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,183
Turing's one of the men that paid.

776
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,102
Only Mr Murray here
then has the bright idea

777
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,771
of robbing Turing's house after,
with a friend.

778
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,982
That's what Turing's hiding.

779
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,484
Well, he's a poof, not a spy.

780
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,028
- No.
- What's the matter?

781
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,530
We can charge a university professor
with indecency.

782
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:57,742
No, this is... It's bloody rubbish.
Turing's up to something important.

783
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:00,036
He's committed a crime
and he's broken the law.

784
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,537
And with a bloke.

785
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,247
Jesus Christ, it's bloody disgusting.

786
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,124
This isn't the investigation
I was conducting.

787
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,293
Bring him in.

788
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,170
Wait.

789
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,382
Let me interrogate him. Please.
Give me half an hour alone

790
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,010
and then I swear, I'll spend
the next month running errands

791
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,345
on as many rubbish cases as you like.

792
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:20,306
Fine.

793
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,975
Now, will someone get me a warrant
for the arrest of Alan Turing?

794
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,118
Alan?

795
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,704
Christopher's simply not
moving fast enough.

796
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,916
- We should talk.
- And even with the diagonal board,

797
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,251
he's still not eliminating settings
as quickly as we need him to...

798
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,712
- I'm leaving.
- But you've just walked in.

799
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,341
No. No, Bletchley.

800
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,927
- What?
- It's my parents.

801
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,680
I'm 25, I'm unmarried,
I'm living alone and they want me home.

802
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,350
That's just ridiculous.

803
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,352
That's my parents.

804
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,688
You... You can't leave. I won't let you.

805
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,732
"I'll miss you."

806
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,984
That's what a normal person
might say in this situation.

807
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,070
I don't care what is normal.

808
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:17,863
What am I supposed to do, Alan?

809
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:23,536
I... I will not give up my parents.

810
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,371
You...

811
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:29,375
You have an opportunity here
to make some actual use of your life.

812
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,710
And end up like you? No, thanks.

813
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:37,550
I'm sorry you're lonely
but Enigma will not save you.

814
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,469
Can you decipher that,
you fragile narcissist?

815
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:43,389
Or would you like me to go and fetch
your precious Christopher to help?

816
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,771
I'm sorry.

817
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:00,489
I want you...
I want you to stay because I like you.

818
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,617
I like talking to you.

819
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,579
I like talking to you, too, Alan.

820
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:15,921
And what if you weren't alone?
What if you had a husband?

821
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,258
Do you have one in mind?

822
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,510
I do.

823
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,679
Hugh?

824
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,681
Hugh's terribly attractive,
I'll give you that,

825
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,017
but I don't really think
he's the marrying kind.

826
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,936
No, I... I wasn't thinking of Hugh.

827
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,981
Or Peter. Peter's so quiet.

828
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,030
Oh, my God.

829
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,617
- But this makes sense.
- Did you just propose to me?

830
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,286
Well, it is the logical thing to do.

831
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,621
This is ridiculous.

832
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:49,788
This is your parents.

833
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,374
I can't believe
that this is happening.

834
01:01:57,005 --> 01:01:58,464
Joan...

835
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,508
Is your middle name
Caroline or Catherine?

836
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:02,635
Elizabeth.

837
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,138
Erm, Joan Elizabeth Clarke, erm...

838
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,352
will you marry me?

839
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:21,987
It's beautiful.

840
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,157
Well, I know it isn't ordinary but...

841
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,911
whoever loved ordinary?

842
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,622
She had it in both hands.

843
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,667
And she looked up at me
with her doe eyes and said,

844
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,794
"Am I supposed to put that in my mouth?"

845
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:40,089
And I said,
"Yes, you know, the French way."

846
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,260
So she pops it in,
clamps her lips around it,

847
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,346
and starts humming
the bloody Marseillaise.

848
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,060
- Come and have a dance.
- No, no, no, no.

849
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,687
You can dance with your fiancé
any time you like.

850
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,563
Right now, this moment...

851
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,648
...my turn.

852
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,720
What's the matter?

853
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,893
What if...

854
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:45,779
What if I don't fancy being with Joan
in that way?

855
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,826
Because you're a homosexual?

856
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,998
I suspected.

857
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:01,670
Well, should I tell her
that I've had affairs with men?

858
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:07,092
You know, in my admittedly
limited experience,

859
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:11,597
women tend to be a bit touchy about
accidentally marrying homosexuals.

860
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:16,268
Perhaps not spreading this information
about might be in your best interest.

861
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:22,107
I care for her, I truly do. I...

862
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:29,365
I... I just don't know if I can, erm...

863
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:32,951
- pretend about...
- You can't tell anyone, Alan.

864
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,454
It's illegal.

865
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,708
And Denniston is looking
for any excuse he can to put you away.

866
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,795
- I know.
- This has to stay a secret.

867
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,797
Come on, it's your turn.

868
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,632
Ah, okay.

869
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,096
It's a sport for girls!

870
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,515
It's not a sport for girls!

871
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:12,426
- Cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

872
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,066
Mr Turing, can I tell you a secret?

873
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,611
I'm quite good with those.

874
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,446
I'm here to help you.

875
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,575
Oh, clearly.

876
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,626
Can machines think?

877
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:49,087
Oh, so you've read some
of my published works?

878
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:50,923
What makes you say that?

879
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,259
Well, because I'm sitting
in a police station

880
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,845
accused of entreating
a young man to touch my penis

881
01:06:56,930 --> 01:07:00,682
and you just asked me
if machines can think.

882
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,102
Well, can they?

883
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,107
Could machines ever think
as human beings do?

884
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,860
Most people say not.

885
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,112
You're not most people.

886
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,993
Well, the problem is
you're asking a stupid question.

887
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,412
I am?

888
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:26,208
Of course machines
can't think as people do.

889
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:30,546
A machine is different from a person.

890
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,800
Hence they think differently.

891
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,847
The interesting question is
just because something,

892
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,016
er, thinks differently from you,

893
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,686
does that mean it's not thinking?

894
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:51,817
Well, we allow for humans to have
such divergences from one another.

895
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,739
You like strawberries.
I hate ice-skating.

896
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:00,617
You cry at sad films.

897
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,869
I am allergic to pollen.

898
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:07,916
What is the point
of different tastes, different...

899
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,462
...preferences if not to say
that our brains work differently,

900
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,756
that we think differently?

901
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,011
And if we can say
that about one another,

902
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,139
then why can't we say
the same thing for brains

903
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,017
built of copper and wire, steel?

904
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:31,231
And that's this big paper you wrote?
What's it called?

905
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,109
The Imitation Game.

906
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,528
Right, that's... That's what it's about?

907
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,577
Would you like to play?

908
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,747
- Play?
- It's a game.

909
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,290
A test of sorts.

910
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:54,546
For determining whether something
is a... a machine or a human being.

911
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,717
- How do I play?
- Well, there's a judge and a subject.

912
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:03,555
And the judge asks questions
and depending on the subject's answers,

913
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,894
determines who he is talking with, er,
what he is talking with and, um,

914
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,315
all you have to do
is ask me a question.

915
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,822
What did you do during the war?

916
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,075
I worked in a radio factory.

917
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,454
What did you really do during the war?

918
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,752
Are you paying attention?

919
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,356
Damn it!

920
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,533
We're soon out of time. Our month.

921
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:07,369
So that's it, then, is it?

922
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,746
Oh, the trouble is it doesn't matter
how much we improve it.

923
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,373
The machine's never
going to be able to process

924
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,750
159 million million million
possibilities in time.

925
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,460
It's just bloody hopeless.

926
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,171
It's searching. It's just...

927
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,842
It doesn't know what it's searching for.

928
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:24,302
If we knew what the messages
were going to say...

929
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:25,929
If we knew what the messages
were going to say,

930
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,472
we wouldn't have to decrypt them at all.

931
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,479
Who's Alan's friend?

932
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,816
Hugh? He's a bit of a cad, actually.

933
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,152
So my type, then?

934
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,320
- Well, I'll introduce you.
- No...

935
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,448
He'll come over.

936
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:46,366
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

937
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:49,327
I smiled at him 15 minutes ago
and haven't looked back since.

938
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,665
- Who's that with Joan?
- Mmm?

939
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:57,043
Er, Helen. Works with her.

940
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,628
She's really pretty.

941
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,172
She wants me to come over.

942
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,883
What? How... How on earth
can you know that?

943
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:05,844
She smiled at me a while back
and she hasn't looked again since.

944
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,560
And got him.

945
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:17,355
Now, why is this, that when
I was single I found it very boring,

946
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,025
but now that I'm engaged,
I just find it dreadfully fun?

947
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,196
Bingo, she's in.

948
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,906
Alan, introduce us.

949
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,908
What?  Why me?

950
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:31,828
Because there's nothing
like a friend's engagement

951
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:33,997
to make a woman want to do
something she'll later regret

952
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:37,042
with the fiancé's
better-looking chum. Let's go.

953
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,634
Half a crown says
Alan bollockses this up entirely.

954
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,177
No bet.

955
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,429
- Alan Turing has a theory.
- He has many.

956
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:52,432
He believes that the regulations
against men and women

957
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:54,976
working side by side are sound

958
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,521
because such proximity
will necessarily lead to romance.

959
01:11:57,605 --> 01:12:00,941
- Er, what? No, I don't. I...
- However, I disagree.

960
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,567
- You do?
- Yeah.

961
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,028
I think that if I were working
beside a woman all day long,

962
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,823
I could appreciate
her abilities and intellect

963
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,574
without taking her to bed.

964
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:12,619
I'm sorry, have we met?

965
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,330
I don't recall.
But let's assume we haven't.

966
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,082
Helen Stewart, Hugh Alexander.

967
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,042
So who do you agree with?
Alan or myself?

968
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,752
Well, Alan, of course.

969
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,880
I'm very flattered really, but I...
I don't think that...

970
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:25,507
Rubbish.

971
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,884
Well, I work beside a man every day

972
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:30,220
and I can't help but have developed
a bit of a crush on him.

973
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,180
Well, who is this man?
So I can kick his arse.

974
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:34,182
Oh, there's no need to worry,
it's been chaste.

975
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:37,185
We've never even met. He's a German.

976
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,396
Now I really want to kill him.

977
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,275
Er... How... How do you mean
you work alongside a German?

978
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:47,404
Well, each of us intercepts messages
from a specific German radio tower.

979
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,989
So we have a counterpart
on the other side

980
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,532
who's tip-tapping out the messages.

981
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,284
Everyone types a touch differently,

982
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,494
so you get to know
the rhythm of your counterpart.

983
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,371
It's strangely intimate.

984
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,331
I feel as if I know him so well.

985
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,749
It's a pity he has a girlfriend

986
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:02,377
but that's why I disagree
with you, Mr Alexander,

987
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,379
because I'm in love
with a co-worker of sorts

988
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,881
and we've never even met.

989
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:09,050
Well, allow me to buy you another pint
and I'll tell you why you're wrong.

990
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,177
Let's.

991
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,263
Excellent.

992
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,183
Thanks.

993
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:21,187
Erm... Pints and a sloe gin.

994
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,610
In case you were wondering,
that's what flirting looks like.

995
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,153
Helen!

996
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,531
- Alan!
- Yes, Alan?

997
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,285
Why do you think your German
counterpart has a girlfriend?

998
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:36,870
It's just a stupid joke.
Don't worry about it.

999
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,496
No, no, no, no, no. Tell me.

1000
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,208
Well, each of his messages
begins with the same five letters.

1001
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,377
C-I-L-L-Y.

1002
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,172
So I suspect that Cilly
must be the name of his amore.

1003
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,382
But that's impossible.
The Germans are instructed to use

1004
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:51,551
five random letters
at the start of every message.

1005
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,261
Well, this bloke doesn't.

1006
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,931
Love will make a man
do strange things, I suppose.

1007
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,099
In this case,

1008
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,060
love just lost Germany
the whole bloody war!

1009
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:02,771
- Oh!
- Go, Peter.

1010
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,066
Sorry.

1011
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,778
Alan!

1012
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,530
Alan!

1013
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,616
- Whoa, whoa!
- Stop!

1014
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:17,869
- No, no, no...
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1015
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:22,791
Hugh Alexander. John Cairncross.
Peter bloody Hilton.

1016
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,793
Alan?

1017
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,419
What...

1018
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:31,383
What... What if...

1019
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:35,887
What if Christopher doesn't have to
search through all of the settings?

1020
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:38,473
What if he only has to search through

1021
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,977
ones that produce words we already
know will be in the message?

1022
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:44,896
- Repeated words. Predictable words.
- Exactly.

1023
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,317
Look. Look, like this one.

1024
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,903
"0600 hours. Weather today is clear.
Rain in the evening.

1025
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,405
"Heil Hitler."

1026
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,574
Oh, that's it.

1027
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,076
Exactly.

1028
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:01,413
They send a weather report
every day at 6:00 a.m.

1029
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,748
So that's... That's three words we...

1030
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,084
we know will be
in every 6:00 a.m. message.

1031
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,837
Er, "weather", obviously and...

1032
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,256
- Heil bloody Hitler?
- Heil bloody Hitler!

1033
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,384
Here's the 6:00 message
from this morning.

1034
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:24,436
Hugh, the, er, the right-hand
letter wheels. Set them to...

1035
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,937
Yes, yes, I know.
"Weather" and "Hitler".

1036
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,439
- Peter, John.
- Yes.

1037
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,858
Run voltages through those letters,
through the back scramblers.

1038
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:31,443
- So we'll use the loops?
- Yes.

1039
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,611
Joan, what was the last
6:00 a.m. message?

1040
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:35,280
- L.
- L.

1041
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,116
- H.
- H.

1042
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,702

01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,456
Q.

1045
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,293
Done.

1046
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,979
Come on. Come on, Christopher.

1047
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:25,997
Oh, my God.

1048
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,506
What... What happened?

1049
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,259
- Did it work?
- Alan?

1050
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:40,386
Alan! Alan!

1051
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:44,849
I need a new message.

1052
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,351
The latest intercept.

1053
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,023
Thanks.

1054
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:54,818
E...

1055
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:58,029
O... T.

1056
01:16:58,114 --> 01:16:59,280

Heil Hitler.

Turns out that's the only German
you need to know to break Enigma.

My God, you did it.

1093
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,836
You just defeated Nazism
with a crossword puzzle.

1094
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,338
There are five people
in the world

1095
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:21,965
who know the position
of every ship in the Atlantic.

1096
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,426
- They're all in this room.
- Oh, good God.

1097
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,346
Oh, I don't think even He has
the power that we do right now.

1098
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:31,474
No, there's going to be an attack
on a British passenger convoy.

1099
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:33,935
- Right there.
- Oh, God, you're right.

1100
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:36,271
All those U-boats
are only 20, 30 minutes away.

1101
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,606
Civilians. Hundreds of them.
We can save their lives.

1102
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,108
I'll phone Denniston's office

1103
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,609
- so that he can alert the Admiralty.
- No.

1104
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:42,860
Do you think there's enough time
to save them?

1105
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,612
There should be if we can get
a message to that convoy.

1106
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,447
Commander Denniston's office, please.
It's urgent.

1107
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,950
- No.
- What the hell are you doing?

1108
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:50,785
You... You... You can't call Denniston.

1109
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:53,037
You... You can't tell him
about the attack.

1110
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:54,539
What are you talking about?

1111
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,291
We can have air support
over that convoy in 10 minutes.

1112
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,876
- Let the U-boat sink the convoy.
- Look, it's been a big day,

1113
01:19:59,003 --> 01:20:00,795
maybe you're suffering
from a bit of shock...

1114
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,797
- We don't have time for this.
- No!

1115
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,884
- That's enough! That's enough!
- Stop, Hugh!

1116
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:08,386
John, the attack is in minutes.

1117
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,639
Yes, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1118
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,558
I'm fine.

1119
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:16,978
Do you know why
people like violence, Hugh?

1120
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:20,857
It's because it feels good.

1121
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:26,654
Sometimes we can't do what feels good.
We have to do what is logical.

1122
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,406
What's logical?

1123
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:32,076
Hardest time to lie to somebody
is when they're expecting to be lied to.

1124
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:35,079
- Oh, God.
- What?

1125
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:38,249
If someone's waiting for a lie,
you can't just, er, give them one.

1126
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,586
Oh, damn it, Alan's right.

1127
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,005
What?

1128
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:47,925
What would the Germans think
if we destroy their U-boats?

1129
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,677
Nothing. They'll be dead.

1130
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:53,181
No. No, you can't be right.

1131
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:56,517
So our convoy suddenly veers off course.

1132
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:59,354
A squadron of RAF bombers

1133
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:02,940
miraculously descends on
the coordinates of the U-boats.

1134
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,861
What will the Germans think?

1135
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:12,450
The Germans will know
that we have broken Enigma.

1136
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:16,537
They'll stop all radio
communications by midday

1137
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:19,040
and they'll have changed
the design of Enigma by the weekend.

1138
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,583
Yes.

1139
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:23,378
Two years' work.

1140
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:27,215
Everything that we've done here,
it will all be for nothing.

1141
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,802
There are
500 civilians in that convoy.

1142
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,429
Women, children.

1143
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,557
We're about to let them die.

1144
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:40,228
Our job is not to save
one passenger convoy,

1145
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,230
it is to win the war.

1146
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:45,441
- Our job was to crack Enigma.
- Well, we've done that.

1147
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,986
Now for the hard part.

1148
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:52,740
- Keeping it a secret.
- Carlisle.

1149
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:55,493
What?

1150
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,162
The convoy you're about to...
It's, er...

1151
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:00,623
The HMS Carlisle is one of the ships.

1152
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,169
We can't act on every
piece of intelligence.

1153
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:06,838
So, fine, we won't.

1154
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,340
Just this one.

1155
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,592
Peter, what's the matter with you?

1156
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,345
My... My brother's...

1157
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,347
Well, he's on the Carlisle.

1158
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,518
A gunnery ensign.

1159
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,022
I'm...

1160
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:28,651
I'm so sorry.

1161
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,656
Who the hell do you think you are?

1162
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,867
This... This is my brother.

1163
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,787
Look, he's my big brother, all right?

1164
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:41,456
And you have a few minutes
to call off his murder.

1165
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,333
We can't.

1166
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,503
He's right.

1167
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,131
Alan...

1168
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:52,508
Joan...

1169
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,387
Hugh... John.

1170
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:00,558
Oh, please, I...

1171
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,477
The Germans, they won't get suspicious

1172
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:04,061
just because we stop one attack.

1173
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,063
No one will know.

1174
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:09,525
I'm asking you as your friend.

1175
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,570
Please.

1176
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,700
I'm so sorry.

1177
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:22,330
You're not God, Alan, you don't
get to decide who lives and who dies.

1178
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:24,707
Yes, we do.

1179
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:29,253
Why?

1180
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:31,672
Because no one else can.

1181
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,472
Why are you telling me this?

1182
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:27,979
We need your help to keep this a secret
from Admiralty, Army, RAF.

1183
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:34,610
No one can know we broke Enigma.
Not even Denniston.

1184
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:37,613
Who's in the process
of having you fired.

1185
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,490
You can take care of that.

1186
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:42,243
While we develop a system
to help you determine

1187
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:45,329
how much intelligence to act on.

1188
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,790
Which, er, attacks to stop,
which to let through.

1189
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,334
Statistical analysis.

1190
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:54,088
The minimal number of actions
it would take for us to win the war

1191
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:59,760
but the maximum number we can take
before the Germans get suspicious.

1192
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,681
And you're going to
trust all this to statistics?

1193
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:06,684
- To maths?
- Correct.

1194
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:10,354
And then MI6 can come up with
the lies that we tell everybody else.

1195
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,607
You'll need a believable
alternative source

1196
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:15,276
for all the pieces
of information you use.

1197
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,445
A false story so that we can explain

1198
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:20,448
how we got our information
that has nothing to do with Enigma.

1199
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:23,618
And then you can leak those
stories to the, er, the Germans.

1200
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,286
And then to our own military.

1201
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:35,630
Maintain a conspiracy of lies
at the highest levels of government?

1202
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,806
Sounds right up my alley.

1203
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:53,064
Alan, I so rarely
have cause to say this,

1204
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:56,567
but you are exactly the man
I always hoped you would be.

1205
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:13,417
They codenamed it Ultra.

1206
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:18,005
It became the largest store
of military intelligence

1207
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,715
in the history of the world.

1208
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:29,767
It was like having a tap
on Himmler's intercom.

1209
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,061
I-E-O...

1210
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:34,772
T-X-X...

1211
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:37,108
Secrecy became
the primary concern

1212
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:40,069
and for some reason, they...
They trusted me.

1213
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:46,450
Peter, do you have the, er...
the 6:30 decrypt?

1214
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:28,659
It's a Beale cipher.

1215
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,244
Encrypted with a phrase from a...

1216
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:33,164
"Ask, and it shall be given
to you; seek and ye will find."

1217
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,666
Matthew 7:7. That was the key.

1218
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:38,002
Peter will come around eventually.

1219
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:48,512
Jack?

1220
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,514
Could you give Alan
and me a moment, please?

1221
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:05,321
The Soviets and us,
we're on the same side.

1222
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:08,866
What I'm doing will help Britain.

1223
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,494
I have to tell Denniston.

1224
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:13,788
No, you don't.

1225
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,208
Because if you tell him my secret,

1226
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,543
I'll tell him yours.

1227
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:24,632
Do you know what they do to homosexuals?

1228
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:28,886
You'll never be able to work again.
Never be able to teach.

1229
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,387
Your precious machine?

1230
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,557
I doubt you'll ever see him again.

1231
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,075
Hello. Can I...

1232
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,994
um, speak to Stewart Menzies,
please? It's urgent.

1233
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:55,996
One moment, please.

1234
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:00,918
Hello. Menzies.

1235
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:07,216
Some advice
about keeping secrets.

1236
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:13,430
It's a lot easier if you
don't know them in the first place.

1237
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:18,853
Were they steaming my letters,
tapping my telephone?

1238
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:21,188
Trailing my nervous walks?

1239
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:23,691
You know, I...

1240
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,610
I never did find out.

1241
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:28,904
Joan?

1242
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:34,910
Joan? What's...

1243
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:40,082
Oh. Where's Joan?

1244
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:43,252
Military prison.

1245
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:47,715
What have you done?

1246
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,300
Decoded Enigma intercepts.

1247
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:51,218
I found a pile of them
in the bedside table.

1248
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,471
No, no. I... I gave those to her
over a year ago

1249
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:56,390
when I was trying to figure out

1250
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:58,309
- a link between...
- I'm sure you did.

1251
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:00,394
Denniston's been looking
for a Soviet spy.

1252
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:01,937
He's been looking inside Hut 8.

1253
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,399
I know who the spy is.

1254
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,944
It... It's not Joan. It's...

1255
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,740
It's Cairncross.

1256
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:15,951
I... I found the Beale cipher,
the Bible.

1257
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:19,622
God, I wish you'd been the spy.

1258
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,083
You'd be so much better
at this than he is.

1259
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:26,587
You knew it was him?

1260
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,505
Of course I bloody knew.

1261
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,674
I knew before he came to Bletchley.

1262
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:33,093
Why do you think I had him placed here?

1263
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,804
But we have an Enigma machine.

1264
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,431
Yes, Polish Intelligence smuggled...

1265
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:38,933
So what's the problem?

1266
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:43,520
You placed a...
a Soviet agent at Bletchley Park?

1267
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:46,815
It's really quite useful to be able to
leak whatever we want to Stalin.

1268
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:50,861
Churchill's too damn paranoid.

1269
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:54,865
He won't share a shred
of intelligence with the Soviets.

1270
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,284
Not even information that
will help them against the Germans.

1271
01:30:57,369 --> 01:31:00,204
There's... so much secrecy.

1272
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:05,125
Cairncross has no idea
we know, of course.

1273
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,711
He's really not the brightest bulb.

1274
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,382
Which is why I need your help.

1275
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:13,133
I want to know what to leak to John,

1276
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:15,886
what to feed to the Soviets
as well as the British.

1277
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:17,471
I...

1278
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:20,516
I'm not a... I'm not a spy. I'm...

1279
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,894
I'm just a mathematician.

1280
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:26,063
I know a lot of spies, Alan.

1281
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:30,317
You've got more secrets
than the best of them.

1282
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:38,158
You... You have to promise me
that you will release Joan.

1283
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,411
Yes, Joan's at the market.

1284
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:42,746
She's going to be back
in an hour. I lied.

1285
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,750
I'd better hold on to these.

1286
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:50,713
If anybody finds out about them,
prison will be the least of her worries.

1287
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,591
Oh, Alan,

1288
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:58,679
we're going to have
such a wonderful war together.

1289
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:19,700
I need you to leave Bletchley.

1290
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:20,868
What?

1291
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:23,370
It's Menzies.
I don't trust him.

1292
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,122
It's not safe here.

1293
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:26,790
Do you think
it's any safer anywhere else?

1294
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,293
You need to get away.
You need to get very far away from me.

1295
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:30,794
Alan, what's happened?

1296
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,885
We can't be engaged any more. You...

1297
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:41,472
Your parents need to take you back
and find you a husband elsewhere.

1298
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:45,476
What's wrong with you?

1299
01:32:46,436 --> 01:32:49,271
I have something, er, to tell you.

1300
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:50,814
I'm...

1301
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,611
I'm a homosexual.

1302
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:01,825
- All right.
- No, no. Men, Joan.

1303
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,329
- Not women.
- So what?

1304
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:07,998
Well, I... I just told you.

1305
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:09,500
So what?

1306
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,838
I had my suspicions, I always did.

1307
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:20,010
But we're not like other people.
We love each other in our own way

1308
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:22,179
and we can have the life together
that we want.

1309
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:24,640
You... You won't be the perfect husband.

1310
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,852
Well, I can promise you, I harbour
no intention of being the perfect wife.

1311
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:33,440
I'll not be fixing your lamb all day
while you come home from the office.

1312
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:35,025
I'll work.

1313
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:37,361
You'll work.

1314
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,031
And we'll have each other's company.

1315
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:44,159
We'll have each other's minds.

1316
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:47,329
That sounds like a better
marriage than most.

1317
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,333
Because I care for you.

1318
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:54,461
And you care for me.

1319
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:58,215
And we understand
one another more than...

1320
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:00,717
more than anyone else ever has.

1321
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:03,971
I don't.

1322
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:09,351
- What?
- Care for you.

1323
01:34:10,228 --> 01:34:11,645
I never did.

1324
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:14,731
I... I just needed you to break Enigma.

1325
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:17,651
I've done that now, so... So you can go.

1326
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:25,534
I'm not going anywhere.

1327
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,662
I've spent entirely too much of my life

1328
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:30,247
worried about what you think of me

1329
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:32,249
or what my parents think of me

1330
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,418
or the boys in Hut 8
or the girls in Hut 3.

1331
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,086
And do you know what? I'm done.

1332
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:40,924
This is the most important
work I will ever do

1333
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:44,386
and no one is going to stop me,
least of all you.

1334
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,683
Do you know what? They were right.

1335
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,769
Peter, Hugh, John.

1336
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:58,025
You really are a monster.

1337
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:21,715
The war dragged on
for two more solitary years

1338
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:27,846
and every day we performed
our blood-soaked calculus.

1339
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:33,435
Every day we decided
who lived and who died.

1340
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:38,357
Every day we helped the Allies
to victories and nobody knew.

1341
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,029
Stalingrad.

1342
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:47,824
The Ardenne. The invasion of Normandy.

1343
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:51,161
All victories that would not
have been possible

1344
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:53,372
without the intelligence
that we supplied.

1345
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:57,668
And people talk about the war

1346
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:01,713
as this epic battle
between civilisations.

1347
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:06,969
Freedom versus tyranny.
Democracy versus Nazism.

1348
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:12,766
Armies of millions
bleeding into the ground.

1349
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:16,019
Fleets of ships
weighing down the oceans.

1350
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:20,023
Planes dropping bombs from the sky
until they obliterated the sun itself.

1351
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:24,569
The war wasn't like that for us.

1352
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:29,074
For us it was just...

1353
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,995
half a dozen crossword enthusiasts

1354
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:35,580
in a tiny village
in the South of England.

1355
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,460
...your victory.

1356
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:42,004
It is the victory

1357
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:47,551
of the cause of freedom in every land.

1358
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:55,350
This is a solemn but glorious hour.

1359
01:36:56,811 --> 01:37:01,231
I wish that Franklin D Roosevelt
had lived to see this day.

1360
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:03,900
Was I God? No.

1361
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:07,279
Because God didn't
win the war,

1362
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,115
we did.

1363
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:24,588
So what happens now?

1364
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:29,426
Is it back to university for us,
I suppose?

1365
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:31,636
Yes, pretty much.

1366
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:33,305
But you've one other thing left to do

1367
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:35,599
before your service
to your government is concluded.

1368
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:38,602
- What's that?
- Burn everything.

1369
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,145
Burn? Why?

1370
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:43,273
You were told when you started
this was a top secret programme.

1371
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:44,983
Did you think we were joking?

1372
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,277
But the war is over.

1373
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,613
This war is.
But there'll be others.

1374
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,032
And we know how to break a code

1375
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:54,743
that everybody else
believes is unbreakable.

1376
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,037
Precisely.

1377
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:00,415
Tear it down, light it up.

1378
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,835
Sweep away the ashes.
None of you have ever met before.

1379
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,172
None of you have ever
even heard the word "Enigma".

1380
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:11,134
Have a safe trip home.

1381
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:16,306
Behave.

1382
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:18,100
With a bit of luck,
you'll never have to see me

1383
01:38:18,184 --> 01:38:20,727
or one another again
for the rest of your lives.

1384
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:37,744
That's unbelievable.

1385
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:41,832
Now, Detective,

1386
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:45,502
you get to judge.

1387
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:49,548
So tell me,

1388
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:52,801
what am I?

1389
01:38:54,637 --> 01:38:58,473
Am I a machine? Am I a person?

1390
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:01,935
Am I a war hero?

1391
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:06,440
Am I a criminal?

1392
01:39:10,486 --> 01:39:12,154
I can't judge you.

1393
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:16,908
Well, then.

1394
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:23,248
You're no help to me at all.

1395
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:27,878
Come in.

1396
01:39:32,258 --> 01:39:34,301
You wanted to see me, sir?

1397
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:36,094
Turing. Sit down.

1398
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:49,900
Is something the matter?

1399
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:53,445
You and Christopher Morcom
are quite close.

1400
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:55,405
I wouldn't say that.

1401
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:56,990
Well, your mathematics teacher says

1402
01:39:57,074 --> 01:39:58,700
the two of you
are positively inseparable.

1403
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:00,744
We're the best students in the class.

1404
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:03,705
He caught you passing
notes the other day.

1405
01:40:03,789 --> 01:40:06,833
Cryptography, to pass the time.
The class is too simple.

1406
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:10,795
You and your friend solve
maths problems during maths class

1407
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,547
because the maths class is too dull?

1408
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:15,133
He's not my friend.

1409
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:18,595
- Well, I'm told he's your only friend.
- Who said that?

1410
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:24,434
Something's come up concerning Morcom.

1411
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:26,811
Why am I here?

1412
01:40:29,607 --> 01:40:31,358
Christopher is dead.

1413
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:41,493
I don't understand.

1414
01:40:41,577 --> 01:40:45,622
His mother sent word this morning.
The family were on holiday, you see.

1415
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:51,753
I don't understand.

1416
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:55,715
Well, he had bovine tuberculosis,
as I'm sure he told you.

1417
01:40:56,926 --> 01:41:02,264
So this won't come as a shock
but still, all the same, I'm sorry.

1418
01:41:04,433 --> 01:41:06,059
You're mistaken.

1419
01:41:07,687 --> 01:41:09,145
Did he not tell you?

1420
01:41:10,356 --> 01:41:12,774
Well, he's been sick for a long time.

1421
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:14,901
He knew this was coming soon.

1422
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,154
But he had a stiff upper lip about it.

1423
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:19,739
Good lad.

1424
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,868
- Are you all right, Turing?
- Yes. Of course.

1425
01:41:23,953 --> 01:41:26,788
Like I said,
I didn't know him very well.

1426
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:30,125
Ah, I see. Very well.

1427
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:37,007
May I leave, Headmaster?

1428
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:53,023
Congratulations, sir.

1429
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:22,177
Sorry.

1430
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:29,684
I would have come.
I would have testified.

1431
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:34,648
And what would you have said?
That I... I wasn't a homosexual?

1432
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:38,193
Alan, this is serious.
They could send you to jail.

1433
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:39,694
Oh, damn it.

1434
01:42:43,032 --> 01:42:46,117
- Your hands, you're twitching.
- No. No, I'm not.

1435
01:42:46,202 --> 01:42:47,619
- Alan.
- Er...

1436
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:51,539
It's the medication.

1437
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:54,125
The medication?

1438
01:42:55,544 --> 01:42:59,172
Well, the judge gave me, um, a choice.

1439
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:03,426
Either two years in prison or
hor... hormonal therapy.

1440
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:04,928
Oh, my God.

1441
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:08,390
- Oh, my God!
- Yes, yes, that's right.

1442
01:43:08,474 --> 01:43:11,017
Chemical castration.

1443
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:15,063
To, er, to cure me of my, um,
homosexual predilections.

1444
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:19,359
Well, of course I chose that.
I mean, I couldn't...

1445
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:22,696
work in prison and...

1446
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:25,115
All right.

1447
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:28,868
Now, I'm going to speak to your doctors.

1448
01:43:28,953 --> 01:43:31,705
- I'm going to speak to your lawyers.
- I'm... I'm fine.

1449
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:33,540
- Please let me help you.
- No, I...

1450
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:36,084
I don't need your help, thank you.

1451
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:38,503
Alan, you do not have to do this alone.

1452
01:43:39,839 --> 01:43:41,423
I'm not alone.

1453
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:46,678
Never have been.

1454
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:53,643
Christopher's become so smart.

1455
01:43:56,856 --> 01:44:00,984
If I don't continue
my treatment, then they'll...

1456
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:07,490
They'll take him away from me.

1457
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:09,659
You...

1458
01:44:12,621 --> 01:44:16,458
You... You... You can't let them
do that. You can't.

1459
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:20,420
You... You can't let them
leave me alone.

1460
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,258
I don't... I don't want to be alone.

1461
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:26,843
I don't want to be alone.

1462
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,845
All right, all right.

1463
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:30,930
All right.

1464
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:34,058
It's all right, come and sit down.

1465
01:44:37,438 --> 01:44:39,564
It's all right. Come and sit down.

1466
01:44:43,444 --> 01:44:44,903
It's all right.

1467
01:44:55,498 --> 01:44:58,958
Oh, well...

1468
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:02,337
That's a much nicer ring
than the one I... I made you.

1469
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:04,088
Yes.

1470
01:45:04,173 --> 01:45:05,924
His name's Jock.

1471
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:08,760
He's an army man,
if you can believe it.

1472
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:11,262
We work together.

1473
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,893
Why don't we do a crossword puzzle?

1474
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:20,104
It'll only take us five minutes.

1475
01:45:20,189 --> 01:45:21,731
Or in your case, six.

1476
01:45:26,821 --> 01:45:28,238
There.

1477
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,721
Perhaps later.

1478
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:56,516
Yes, of course.

1479
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:04,524
You got what you wanted, didn't you?

1480
01:46:05,651 --> 01:46:07,235
Work, a husband.

1481
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,029
Normal life.

1482
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:22,917
No one normal could have done that.

1483
01:46:27,006 --> 01:46:29,048
Do you know, this morning,

1484
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:34,554
I was on a train that went
through a city that wouldn't exist

1485
01:46:34,638 --> 01:46:36,639
if it wasn't for you.

1486
01:46:38,309 --> 01:46:42,687
I bought a ticket from a man
who would likely be dead

1487
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:45,023
if it wasn't for you.

1488
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:46,941
I read up on my work,

1489
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:51,863
a whole field of scientific inquiry

1490
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:54,991
that only exists because of you.

1491
01:46:58,162 --> 01:47:01,122
Now, if you wish
you could have been normal,

1492
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:05,668
I can promise you, I do not.

1493
01:47:07,838 --> 01:47:10,632
The world is an infinitely better place

1494
01:47:10,716 --> 01:47:13,051
precisely because you weren't.

1495
01:47:16,847 --> 01:47:18,264
Do you...

1496
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:20,850
Do you really think that?

1497
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:23,853
I think

1498
01:47:25,022 --> 01:47:28,816
that sometimes it is the people
who no one imagines anything of

1499
01:47:28,901 --> 01:47:33,446
who do the things
that no one can imagine.
