# subtitle-to-password
Do you have a movie you like? Maybe a series you love? And at the same time, you have to pick a secure password that you have to remember?

SAY NO MORE!
Take two subtitle files, or one file two times! Then choose a length of words you want and how many of them you want.
BAM!
Now you've got a long (pretty)secure password!

Usage:
$ sh subtitle-filter.sh [filename.srt] [filename2.srt] [wordsize] [amount of words]
