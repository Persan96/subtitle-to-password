# subtitle-to-password

Projects intent is that you enter a couple of .srt-files into the program, and the program generates a set length of password consisting of a number of uncommon words found in the subtitles.

Usage:
$ sh subtitle-filter.sh <filename.srt> <filename2.srt> <size per word> <amount of words>
